# Hi, I'm Alam 
I'm a computer science student at McMaster University. I enjoy building real products end-to-end — from backend APIs and data pipelines to modern frontends and AI-powered features.

Right now I'm especially interested in:
- Applied AI (LLMs, speech-to-text, summarization)
- Backend systems (FastAPI, Node, microservices, Docker)
- Data-heavy apps (ETL, dashboards, analytics)

## Featured Projects

### [samurAI](https://github.com/AlamChhina/samurAI)
*AI-powered video-to-notes pipeline*

- FastAPI service that turns long-form videos and URLs into transcripts, summaries, and audio
- Uses OpenAI Whisper for transcription and Edge-TTS for natural-sounding text-to-speech
- Asynchronous job system with a dashboard for tracking job status and downloading outputs
- Fully containerized with Docker and optional GPU acceleration for faster inference

> Repo: `samurAI` (see pinned repositories)

### [TappedIn](https://github.com/AlamChhina/TappedIn)
*Spotify-powered music guessing game*

- Web game that uses the Spotify API and Web Playback SDK to play short audio clips
- OAuth flow restricted to Spotify Premium users
- Focused on low-latency API calls and responsive gameplay, including mobile support
- Caching and deduplication to avoid hitting Spotify’s rate limits on large playlists

### [BuyersBay](https://buyersbay.ca)
*Production-style apps with real-world constraints*

- Built full-stack features around map search, listings, and analytics (e.g., clustering for thousands of pins, efficient Postgres queries)
- Used CI/CD, type-safe APIs, and monitoring to keep deployments smooth and reliable
- Worked with real datasets and external APIs to ship things people actually use
